# 🎥 Skew Your Voice — Portfolio Project

## 🚀 Overview

This is a showcase project designed as part of my hybrid roadmap to demonstrate practical skills in modern full-stack development, DevOps workflows, and cloud deployment.

**Main goals:**
- Build a production-ready React application using Next.js. The app showcases audio/video recording and voice manipulation features already available at https://syv.feedchaos.com.
- The app is deployed on Firebase App Hosting with a scalable setup. Separate Production and Dev versionns are deployed, the dev version showcasing emulation.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline and automated testing strategy.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend & Hosting:** Firebase (App Hosting/Hosting, Firestore, Authentication)
- **Media Handling:** Custom audio/video capture with Web APIs
- **State Management & Context:** React Context, custom hooks
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (e2e)

---

## ⚙️ DevOps & CI/CD

- Automated **linting** and **build** workflows using GitHub Actions.
- Node.js matrix strategy for future-proof compatibility (Node 18.x, 20.x, 22.x).
- Planned progressive rollout of test coverage improvements and Playwright e2e.

---

## 🧪 Testing Roadmap

- ✅ Initial unit and integration tests with basic coverage.
- 🔄 Actively working toward **50%+ coverage**.
- 💡 Playwright end-to-end test suite covering recording workflows and edge cases.

---

## ☁️ Deployment
